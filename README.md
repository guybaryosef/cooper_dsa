## Data Structures and Algorithms Courses in The Cooper Union

## DSA I
### Project 1
A program that implements and manipulates Stacks and Queues based on specified criteria. A focus is placed on OOP design with generic programming.

### Project 2
A program that sorts the nodes of a linked list as fast as possible. There are several linked lists, each containing different data and therefore each is sorted with a different algorithm.

## DSA II
### Project 1
Create a hash table class and use it in a spellchecker program.

### Project 2
Create a binary heap class using the hash table from project 1.

### Project 3
Create a graph class that is able to efficiently run Dijkstra's Algorithm.
Uses both the hash table and the binary heap classes from previous projects.

### Project 4
A DP programming question from 1998's regional ACM Programming Contest.
